##  Plugin Architecture & Parsing Logic

The app features a plugin-based architecture allowing easy integration of new commands and functionalities.

- **Plugin Manager:**  
  A central utility that registers plugins, parses user messages to detect commands, and executes the corresponding plugin logic.

- **Parsing Logic:**  
  When a user sends a message, the input is checked for command patterns like `/weather`, `/calc`, or `/define`.  
  - If a plugin command is detected, the Plugin Manager executes the plugin asynchronously.  
  - While processing, a "Processing..." message appears.  
  - Upon completion, the result is displayed or an error message if the plugin execution fails.  
  - Non-plugin messages receive a generic AI assistant reply.

- **Plugin Interface:**  
  Each plugin exposes:  
  - A `name` and `command` identifier (e.g., `/weather`)  
  - An `execute` function that accepts the input and returns a success status and data or error  
  - A `render` function to display plugin output inside the chat UI
